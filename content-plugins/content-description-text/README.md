# Content Plugin: Description Text

Allows displaying text. Just like `world.text()`. But since this is a plugin, graphical clients can omit this content.

A typical use case would be describing what themes using images would see.

## Content Language additions

```ts
world.descriptionText(
  "You are at a beautiful forest. Wind is rustling through the trees."
);
```
